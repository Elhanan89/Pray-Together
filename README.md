# pray_together

Final Project 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Background

In this challenging period, with the presence of the coronavirus pandemic creating a new reality, 
users need to adhere to the guidelines of the Ministry of Health in order to preserve themselves and the environment. 
As a result, a situation has arisen where worshippers are unable to pray in a congregation as they did before the coronavirus era, especially during holidays.

The Ministry of Health has subsequently issued guidelines stating that prayers can only be conducted together up to a certain number of participants. 
This has led to an imbalance in synagogues concerning the number of worshippers. 
To address this issue, we have decided to develop a system â€“ an application for managing prayers and quotas in synagogues.


## Project Objective and Problem Presentation

The objective of the application is to enable worshippers to find nearby synagogues and register for the relevant synagogue. Additionally, 
it allows the synagogue administrator to manage the quota of worshippers in accordance with the guidelines from the Ministry of Health. 
The application provides additional services to both administrators and worshippers to enhance their interaction.
